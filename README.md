## In a Nutshell
Home Safe is a mobile-friendly, full-stack web app that checks up on you while you're out and texts your friends for you if you don't make it back safely.

1. Whether you're going for a rainy drive or a late night stroll, enter your return time and Home Safe will start a timer
1. If you enter yoru safe code before the timer ends, nothing happens!
1. If you *don't* enter your safe code before the timer ends, Home Safe will text your friends with your last known location.
1. If your enter your emergency code at any point, Home Safe will immediately text your friends.

### Inspiration
I love trail-running, which usually puts me in remote areas by myself. I'm a risk-adverse person who loves slightly risky activities, so I'm all about minimizing risks. I wanted a mobile-friendly app that will alert my friends know if I get eaten by a bear or something. A lot of safe-call apps require you to have your phone on you when you're doing a risky activity, but I don't usually take my phone with me when I run, so I wanted to build something triggered by inaction rather than action.
